# New Relic Datasource - Custom Grafana Plugin
You can use New Relic Datasource plugin to integrate New Relic metrics into Grafana using New Relic APM API. 

## Supported Grafana versions
Grafana version 3.0.0-beta7 and 3.0.1 stable and higher.

## Adding the data source to Grafana

1. Add the contents of this repository to your grafana plugins directory and then restart the grafana server.
- Plugin directory: 
  - /var/lib/grafana/plugins (default)
  - /usr/local/var/lib/grafana/plugins (if installed with brew on mac)

2. Open the side menu by clicking the Grafana icon in the top header and select *Data Sources*.

3. Click the *+ Add data source* button in the top header.

4. Select *NewRelic* from the Type dropdown.

5. Enter the datasource *Name* and *API Key* that can be found New Relic account settings under Integrations->API Keys.

## Query editor
Open a graph in edit mode by click the *Title > Edit* (or by pressing *e* key while hovering over panel).

### Adding single metric to a graph
- Select *Application*, *Metric Namespace*, and *Metric Value* from the dropdown lists.
- Set the operator to *none*.
- Provide *Series Alias* if needed. If left blank, series will be aliased as "MetricNamespace:MetricValue". MetricValue can be accessed as $value when defining the alias.

- The query outputs a graph.

### Adding an expression based on 2 metrics to a graph
- Select *Application*, *Metric Namespace*, and *Metric Value* from the dropdown lists.
- Choose the *Operator*. 4 operators are supported (+, -, *, /).
- Select *Metric Namespace*, and *Metric Value* for the 2nd operand from the dropdown lists.
- Provide *Series Alias* if needed.

### Adding multiple series to a graph
- Add more metrics to the graph by adding another query in the panel editor. Provide meaningful aliases for clarity.

- The graph will have both metrics superimposed.

- Use *Mixed* datasource if you're trying to superimpose metrics from different datasources.

## A note on large result sets from New Relic
New Relic APIs, by default, return 200 results for data and 1000 results for names (see https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apis/rest-api-v2/requirements/pagination-api-output). Paging has been added to the query for Applications, with an arbitrary limit hardcoded at 10 pages (2000 results). Metrics also does paging, with the same 10 page limit (10000 results).
- The hardcoded limit is arbitrary. If you need more than the current maximums, increasing the *finalPageNumber* default value in *NewRelicQueryCtrl.prototype.getApplications* is all that would need to be done.
- The hardcoded limit could be rather easily removed entirely, but exists as a failsafe for not hammering the New Relic API in the event that a bug is introduced that would prevent breaking from the recursive loop.
